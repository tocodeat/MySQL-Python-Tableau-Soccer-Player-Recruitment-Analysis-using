# Soccer-Player-Recruitment

My four teammates and I assumed we are a Chicago-based Sports Analytics firm focused on soccer. Our company specializes in analyzing player performances to provide recruitment solutions to various soccer clubs. Our tool adapts to the needs and resources of each club with the aim of optimizing their recruitment decisions. Our client, the Director of Soccer at Arsenal FC has reached out to us to help him fix the gaps in his team using Analytics backed recommendations.

## Business case:
1. Arsenal FC's performance has been inconsistent for the past 5 years and they are looking to recruit some new players to rejuvenate their squad. The new Director of Soccer at Arsenal FC, Edu Gasper, wants Analytics backed recommendations to improve their squad.
2. He has identified specific positions for which he needs new players. He has reached out to us to help him with suggestions for the recruitment of these players. The recruitment should be based on various positions available and should be within the budget.
3. We need to identify talent, compare profiles, and adjust to the desired characteristics to find the desired player profile fit for the Arsenal team. We will provide visuals for different positions and detailed screens for each player.
